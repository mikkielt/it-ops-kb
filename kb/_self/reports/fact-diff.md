# Fact diff: anchors, calibration and a dry run

Measurements behind `_tools/factdiff.py` and the cut-offs in `_tools/factdiff.toml`. **Setup:** the public root with 2,655 sources, 10,042 fact units and 13,049 fact-source pairs (DOC, CODE, DER and COMMUNITY parts); every cited source fetched once by its provider's raw form (`_tools/providers.csv`); stdlib Python only, no model. Re-run each section with the command it names and replace the section when a new measurement supersedes it.

## Anchor backfill

`python3 _tools/factdiff.py anchor` over every source (2,496 fetched, from the cache of one pass taking about 45 minutes at one request per 1.1 s per host; the matching itself about 100 s).

| status | pairs |
|---|---|
| located | 6,303 (48%; 56% of the pairs whose source returned text) |
| unlocated: no-match | 4,856 |
| unlocated: not-text (zip, tar, xlsx, PDF, binaries) | 1,788 |
| unlocated: fetch-error (DNS, timeouts, 403, 429, 202) | 90 |
| unlocated: gone (404) | 12 |

By tag kind, share located of the pairs with text: DOC 59%, COMMUNITY 56%, CODE 47%, DER 29% (a derivation rarely has one backing sentence). By provider: code.claude.com 76%, raw GitHub 70%, gitlab.com 68%, Learn 56%, modelcontextprotocol.io 47%, docs.gitlab.com 36%, github.com pages 28%, the generic long tail 33%. Quotes (25 words at most, `copy` and `quote` sources only) are kept on 6,236 located anchors; a quote that looks like an address, a home path, a token, a private network or a GUID is left out.

The unlocated pairs are listed, not guessed: `python3 _tools/factdiff.py anchors --unlocated`. They are facts that condense a whole section or table, derivations, probe results (a page's headers, not its text) and facts whose page is client-rendered.

### Anchor thresholds

A labelled sample: 72 fact-source pairs drawn at random, 12 per band of cover (the share of the fact's term weight the best window holds), each read and marked as the right backing passage (a partial one counted as right, since it holds the fact's claim) or a wrong one.

| cover | right | wrong | pairs in the kb |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.30-0.40 | 9 | 3 | 1,744 |
| 0.40-0.45 | 11 | 1 | 885 |
| 0.45-0.50 | 11 | 1 | 765 |
| 0.50-0.55 | 10 | 2 | 733 |
| 0.55-0.65 | 12 | 0 | 1,275 |
| 0.65 and more | 11 | 1 | 2,495 |

Precision is flat at about 92% from 0.40 up (55 of 60) and falls to 75% below it, so `min_cover` is 0.40, with `min_shared` 3 terms, windows of up to 3 units and a cover cost of 0.05 per extra unit. The wrong ones were an image tag (now skipped as a unit), two derivations whose words sit in a related sentence, and a fact about a different service limit on the same page. A wrong anchor can only re-date a fact whose true passage was not checked; it can never change a fact.
